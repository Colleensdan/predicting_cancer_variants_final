## First Time Setup
After cloning for the first time, the following setup is needed:
1. Python 3.6 is needed for the downloader. Python 3.8 can generate a MemoryError when downloading big datasets from cBioPortal.org
2. Pycharm should be opened from the root folder (the one with this README.MD in it) for all the imports to work correctly
3. Two packages will need installing, yaml and requests. Pycharm will prompt to install this if you open configuration.py and downloader.py
4. The project has absolute file specifications in two files which will need changing, these are log file locations in predicting_cancer_variants.yaml and create_database_test_configuration.yaml
